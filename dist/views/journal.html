The home/about page will be fleshed out more after some visualizations are up. The Visualization page will link to the individual visualizations. This page, the journal page, will contain updates every few days. </h3> <!--<p class="post-meta">Posted by <a href="#">Start Bootstrap</a> on September 24, 2014</p>--> </div> <div class="post-preview"> <h2 class="post-title"> February 23, 2015: D3 included. </h2> <h3 class="post-subtitle"> I borrowed a tree visualization from <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/NPashaP/7683252">NPashaP</a> The sourcecode used mostly one character variable names and was partially minimized, so I rewrote it to be more compregensible. </h3> <!--<p class="post-meta">Posted by <a href="#">Start Bootstrap</a> on September 24, 2014</p>--> </div> <hr> <div class="post-preview"> <h2 class="post-title"> March 2, 2015: Binary Tree. </h2> <h3 class="post-subtitle"> I built a binary tree visualization out of <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/NPashaP/7683252">NPashaP's graceful tree code</a> So far, it allows the user to add and remove nodes. I intend to add depth first and bredth first searches as well as node coloring. I am concerned that this binary search visualization, while a good demonstration of a binary tree, does not expose the underlying algorithms visually. </h3> <!--<p class="post-meta">Posted by <a href="#">Start Bootstrap</a> on September 24, 2014</p>--> </div> <hr> <div class="post-preview"> <h2 class="post-title"> April 2, 2015: Coloring for Binary Tree. </h2> <h3 class="post-subtitle"> Now, when adding or removing a node from the binary tree, one can watch as the path is traced out by a D3 animation. D3 does not have a lot of support for long sequences of transitions in animation, particularly when it's unclear how many steps it will take. In my case, I'm able to calculate timing as I find my node, and use this for visualizing afterwards. </h3> <!--<p class="post-meta">Posted by <a href="#">Start Bootstrap</a> on September 24, 2014</p>--> </div> <hr> <div class="post-preview"> <h2 class="post-title"> April 7, 2015: Red Black Trees: Every non-leaf node has two children. </h2> <h3 class="post-subtitle"> In order to make the red-black tree visualization, I've set up a binary tree implementation in which leaves are represented as empty nodes. Every non empty node has 2 children, where one or both of these children may be leaves. It is important that the viewer can see the leaf nodes, because they are colored, and are often players in the rebalancing actions. </h3> </div> <hr> <div class="post-preview"> <h2 class="post-title"> April 10, 2015: Red Black Trees: Insertion </h2> <h3 class="post-subtitle"> Insertion is complete. Debugging was very difficult, but it forced me to understand the actual algorithm, rather than just translate the C implementation on Wikipedia into JavaScript. The out of the box animation, using the D3 from the binary search tree, looks decent, but I will definitely want to make it better, in order to show the actual algorithm better. I'm toying with the idea of displaying some of the code, or pseudocode, on the page, so that viewers can follow along. </h3> </div> <hr> <div class="post-preview"> <h2 class="post-title"> April 12, 2015: Red Black Trees: Deletion </h2> <h3 class="post-subtitle"> Deletion works with a few caveats: 1. Errors when deleting node that doesn't exist  2. Errors when deleting the last node.  3. Needs better animation.  </h3> </div> <hr> <div class="post-preview"> <h2 class="post-title"> April 16, 2015: Red Black Trees: Deletion Bugs and Animation </h2> <h3 class="post-subtitle"> 1. Fixed animation for node addition. 2. Fixed Errors when deleting the last node. 3. Deletion animation almost there. </h3> </div> <hr> <div class="post-preview"> <h2 class="post-title"> April 17, 2015: Red Black Trees: Deletion Bugs and Animation </h2> <h3 class="post-subtitle"> 1. Deletion animation is in! 2. Fixed Error when deleting a node that doesn't exist. </h3> </div> <hr> <div class="post-preview"> <h2 class="post-title"> April 25, 2015: Neural Nets: I've got a Plan. </h2> <h3 class="post-subtitle"> After some discussion with Riccardo Pucella (my advisor), and Alec Radford (friend and founder at Indico), I decided my third visualization would be a neural network. As the network trains, the width of edges between nodes will also changes. Now I need to get neural nets working in the browser... </h3> </div> <hr> <div class="post-preview"> <h2 class="post-title"> April 27, 2015: Neural Nets drawn, but not hooked up. </h2> <h3 class="post-subtitle"> The visualization is in, but not connected to any algorithm. The hardest part was creating arrow heads, but after struggling with a few demo's, I now have a much better idea of how d3 and SVGs work. The trick is create a triangle in the html with no position, and then reference it with the "marker-end" attribute. </h3> </div> <hr> <div class="post-preview"> <h2 class="post-title"> April 30, 2015: Neural Nets working in the browser. </h2> <h3 class="post-subtitle"> Check out these two cool libraries:  <a src="https://github.com/harthur/brain">Heather Arthur's Brain library:</a> Works as long as your app includes a server. (mine doesn't)<br> <a src="http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/">ConvNetJs:</a> No server needed<br> I used ConvNetJs and was pretty happy with the results. It was very tricky to get a neural net that converged appropriately, but the author has many good demo's, so I was able to repurpose one. </h3> </div> <hr> <div class="post-preview"> <h2 class="post-title"> May 5, 2015: Basic Visualization works. </h2> <h3 class="post-subtitle"> The activation that a node receives is a linear combination of the inputs to that node. In order to represent this, I set the width of each arrow pointing at a given node to the product of the parent node's output and the weight that the child gives to that parent's output. This involved deconstructing a little bit of <a src="http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/">ConvNetJs's</a> source code, but I was fortunate that the library was well organized.<br> I update the visualization every 10th of a second, which I've set to coorespond to one tenth of the iterations over the dataset. </h3> </div> <hr> <!--
